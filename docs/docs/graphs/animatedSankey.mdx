Animating this flow is intended to bring out some emotion!

## Component Usage

We give the chart 2 dimensions.
Sankey's flow from left to right. You need to pick which dimension you want to start with on the left and which dimension you want to end with.

```javascript
<SankeyAnimated
  data={data}
  height="600px"
  showLabel={true}
  categoryDimAccessor={(d) => d.sex}
  leftDimAccessor={(d) => d.ses}
  rightDimAccessor={(d) => d.education}
  startingLabel="Socioeconomic status"
/>
```

## data configuration

the data object is an array of objects with the 3 dimensions (category, left, right) and the percentage weighting of the flow of data from left to right.

In order to figure out the percent of flow to the right, the right dimension

Example data structure:

```json
[
  {
    "sex": "female", // categoryDim
    "ses": "low", // leftDim
    "<High School": 5.4, // proportion of rightDim value (adds to 100% when you add all other values)
    "High School": 17.1,
    "Some Post-secondary": 36.2,
    "Post-secondary": 16.0,
    "Associate's": 9.3,
    "Bachelor's and up": 15.9
  }
